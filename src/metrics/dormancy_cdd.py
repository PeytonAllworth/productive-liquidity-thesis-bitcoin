Dormancy & Coin Days Destroyed (CDD/BDD) Metrics

This module analyzes Bitcoin dormancy through Coin Days Destroyed.

What is CDD/BDD?
----------------
Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) or Bitcoin Days Destroyed (BDD) measures
the "age" of coins when they move:

Formula: CDD = Œ£ (amount_btc √ó days_since_last_spent)

Example:
    - You receive 1 BTC on Jan 1
    - You spend it on Jan 31 (30 days later)
    - CDD = 1 BTC √ó 30 days = 30 bitcoin-days destroyed

Theory:
-------
During economic crises, we expect:
- HIGH CDD = Old coins waking up (HODLers liquidating for liquidity)
- This reflects Keynesian liquidity preference: breaking dormancy
  to access liquid funds during uncertainty

Interpretation:
    - Rising BDD = Dormant wealth being mobilized
    - Stable/low BDD = HODLing behavior continues
    
Data Sources:
-------------
1. Blockchain.com API:
   - Provides daily BDD series (easiest option)
   - Historical data available
   
2. Bitcoin Core RPC (advanced):
   - Requires txindex=1
   - For each transaction input:
     a. Look up previous transaction
     b. Calculate age: (current_block_time - prev_tx_time) / 86400 days
     c. Sum: amount √ó age
   - More precise but computationally intensive

Limitations:
------------
- Affected by exchanges moving old UTXOs (not crisis-related)
- Large wallets rebalancing can create spikes
- Consider normalizing by 30-day moving average

"""
Interpreting BDD in Context:
----------------------------

HIGH BDD can indicate:
‚úÖ Liquidity preference (HODLers need cash ‚Üí sell old BTC)
‚úÖ Strategic reallocation (moving from cold storage ‚Üí exchange ‚Üí fiat/goods)
‚úÖ Inheritance/lost-then-recovered keys (old coins awakening)

‚ùå BUT also non-crisis factors:
   - Exchange wallet consolidation (technical, not behavioral)
   - Satoshi's coins moving (would be enormous spike)
   - Whale repositioning (could be unrelated to macro)

For your thesis:
- Focus on relative changes (pre vs. crisis BDD)
- Compare multiple crises for patterns
- Acknowledge limitations in Discussion section
- Consider segmenting by UTXO age buckets (1-2yr, 2-5yr, 5+yr)
